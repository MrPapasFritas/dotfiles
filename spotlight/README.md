## Usage
Run `systemctl --user enable spotlight.timer` to get a new picture every day.

To trigger it manually you can either use the desktop entry by looking for _spotlight_ in your gnome application menu, run `spotlight.sh` in a terminal, or trigger the service manually with `systemctl --user start spotlight.service`.

Use the system log to get the past image descriptions, e.g. for the last two (the current background and lockscreen) `journalctl -t spotlight -n 2`.
